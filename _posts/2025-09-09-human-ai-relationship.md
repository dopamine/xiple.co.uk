In Lisanne Buick's [Ethics for Agentic Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYfdrFd20ls&list=PLxQqv_fazRs1VlMEbqC0Jlw6VFd97UpT2&index=4&ab_channel=SmashingMagazine), the most useful ideas for me were these two, heavily paraphrased:

Two ways of using AI in design:
- _centring the machine_ using genAI to solve the problem start to finish, which results in generic soulless templated solutions
- _centring the human_ using genAI to help tease ideas out of the human (or just generate those straight up offline), and only then use genAI to rapid prototype those organic ideas

 

Question to ask yourself about AI tool use: 
- Does using this tool this increase my connection to, or alienate me from my creativity, other humans and nature?
- Does using this tool this nurture my relationship / enrich my interaction with X, or does it dilute it?
